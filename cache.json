The we-should-be-more-like-Europe crowd has some explaining to do. (The Word Bank's software misplaced the UK label; it is the red line on the top of the European group.) From the World Bank, HT Marginal Revolution.\nThe graph is in dollars, so part of the effect is that the dollar got more valuable relative to the euro. (Thanks to the commenters who noticed that I misread the graph caption. Blog post now fixed to reflect that.) \n\nUpdate\nA correspondent sends along the following graph from IMF data. IMF data uses PPP adjustments, not straight conversion to dollars. So the exchange rate really is an issue in comparing US to EU growth.  \n\n\nRelative inflation has not been that different between the two countries. \n\n\nAt least by these measures, EU inflation has been only very slightly less than US inflation \nSo indeed, the exchange rate is the major part of the difference between the two graphs. Whether PPP or actual exchange rates are \"right\" for this purpose I leave for another day. Certainly the average American's ability to buy European goods has risen relative to the average European's ability to buy American goods. Why exchange rates diverge so long from PPP measures remains, I think, a central puzzle.

In it, he addressed an earlier comment by Liam:\nJohn’s child is dying from cancer. He cannot afford to fly her to a country offering pioneering treatment. Let’s assume it has a reasonably high chance of saving her life. Can John hack into Bill Gates’ bank account and steal the money he needs?\nI take it that Caplan thinks this would be wrong; and yet what could possibly be more demanding than a moral principle which requires you to step back and watch your own child die from cancer? In fact, utilitarianism would probably be less demanding in this case, since you may well increase overall utility by stealing the money.\n\nBryan answered:\nActually, I don’t think this would be wrong.  Like Huemer, I endorse a moderate deontological view that allows rights violations when the benefits vastly exceed the costs.\n\nI was shocked.\nIf Bryan thinks it’s right to steal from Bill Gates to finance expensive cancer surgery with “a reasonably high chance of saving her life,” then that principle must apply to tens of millions of people who could have their lives saved even more cheaply by being able to get food.\nThink of, say, 100 million of the poorest people in India. They could ward off starvation for a year or even two with an extra $1,000. That’s $100 billion, which is enough to wipe out Bill Gates’ net worth, especially after Melinda is done with him.\nThat seems wrong to me. How few people have to benefit from stealing  from Bill Gates to make it right to steal? 10 million? 1 million? 10?\nWorking backward, it seems wrong to me for even one poor parent in India to steal from Bill Gates.\n \n                        (3 COMMENTS)",

He pointed out that the standard law and economics solution to a negative externality is to have the “least-cost avoider” bear the cost of adjustment. I discuss what I learned from that here.\nThere’s a related point. Now that vaccines in the United States are widely available at a zero price and highly effective, who are at the lowest risk? The people who are vaccinated. They face very little risk–on the order of the risk from catching the flu in a normal flu year–whereas the unvaccinated person faces a much higher risk. So the people who should bear the risk are those who, for whatever reasons, don’t get vaccinated. And they should, as Crenshaw says, be allowed to bear the risk.\nYou can’t just say the word “externalities” and win an argument.\n\n                        (3 COMMENTS)",

I picked up a copy of Sol Tax, ed., The Draft: A Handbook of Facts and Alternatives, University of Chicago Press, 1967, and read it cover to cover. It’s a transcript of all the papers given and discussions after the papers from the famous 4-day conference on the draft at the University of Chicago. It took place from December 4 to 7, 1966. It was this conference that Milton Friedman stated, in his joint autobiography with Rose Friedman, Two Lucky People, was an important step toward ending the draft.\nFour people from Congress attended: Democratic Senators Edward M. Kennedy from Massachusetts and Maurine Neuberger from Oregon, Democratic Representative Robert W. Kastenme…",

Apart from this principle there would be no basis for general public support for economics as a legitimate academic discipline, no place for economics as an appropriate part of a liberal educational curriculum. I refer, of course, to the principle of the spontaneous order of the market….\nSpontaneous order is crucial for understanding human institutions as fundamental as language and the law, and as pervasive as morals, markets and money. It is also central to a key defense of individual liberty. Nevertheless, many people find the notion of spontaneous order counter-intuitive, seeing nothing between planning and anarchy. Some respectable academics have even…",

So much, actually, that, if I may push the argument that Strother Roberts makes in Colonial Ecology, Atlantic Economy, Caribbean sugar would not have been possible without New England beavers. And given that by the end of the 18th century, taxes on sugar were the highest source of revenue from imported commodities for the exchequer, beavers played a fundamental role in the British Empire.\nHow so? Because, as Strother Roberts explains, of the interconnections of markets that the British Empire created.\nSugar in the 17th and 18th century was too profita…",

Postjournalism is openly normative; it imposes the world-as-it-should-be.\n—Andrey Mir, Postjournalism1. P. 7 and p. 264.\nAndrey Mir’s Postjournalism offers a powerful, sweeping narrative of how news media have evolved over the centuries. Mir’s framework is that media technology determines how journalism is supported financially, and those who finance news media in turn shape its contents.\nIn the 21st century, the newspaper industry has lost advertising revenue to Internet…",

Over the next three years, there was an almost universal view among NBA basketball fans that the trade was very lopsided, with Atlanta losing badly.\nLast night, Atlanta was eliminated from the playoffs. Nonetheless, one TV commentator suggested that the trade now looks much more even. Young was spectacular in the playoffs before getting hurt a week ago, and while it’s too soon to fully judge Reddish, he looked very good in a couple playoff games after coming off an injury. Atlanta went much further in the playoffs than Dallas.\nThis example demonstrates something I’ve noticed quite often. People are far too quick to make judgments. Pundits that focus on the economy …",

As is currently the case, labor can become more expensive like car rentals have become; it could be very expensive, like BMWs, if demand were even higher compared to supply. But if a market price obtains at which as much as one wants is available, speaking of a shortage is a confusing use of language. Indeed, it is precisely because a non-government-controlled price can rise, thereby reducing quantity demanded and increasing quantity supplied, that there is no shortage. (See my econlog post “Don’t Confuse Shortage and Smurfage.”)\nWhen an employer says he cannot get the labor he needs, he is typically trying to say (assuming that remuneration is determine…",

Through the eyepiece of his homemade 7-foot telescope, he spied an interloper in the constellation Gemini: “a curious, either nebulous star or perhaps a comet,” as he recorded it. For weeks, he stalked the unknown object, monitoring its steady appearance and circular path around the sun until there could be no doubt about its true identity. He had discovered not a comet but a new planet, far more distant than any of the others.\nStormy Weather: These images of Uranus, taken by the Keck II telescope in Hawaii, are the sharpest, most detailed pictures of the planet to date, according to NAS…",

It would glisten and gleam and sparkle and be absolutely captivating,” says neuroscientist Anil Seth. “Somebody looking at me would see me staring at a stone for hours.”\nOr what seemed like hours to Seth. A researcher at the United Kingdom’s University of Sussex, he studies how the brain helps us perceive the world within and without, and is intrigued by what psychedelics such as LSD can tell us about how the brain creates these perceptions. So, a few years ago, he decided to try some, in controlled doses and with trusted people by his side. He had a notebook to keep track of his experiences. “I didn’t write very much in the notebook,” he says, laughing.\nInstead,…",

          "description": "In our evolving understanding of dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex has acquired a new persona in recent decades. It’s always been the imperious, curiously agile two-ton gargantua, personified as a gaunt, grizzle-faced gunfighter at the dark end of the bar, a soulless creature that lived to 30 and possessed a keen sense of smell, good eyesight, surprisingly pliable skin and banana-sized teeth. Add a taste for Triceratops, which it ate by pulling off the head then using its smaller front teeth to nip the soft flesh behind the frill.\nIts newer persona suggests a softer side, a demon looking creature but finally not a psychopath, merely a misunderstood everyman with feathers.

He spent that time trying to improve himself mentally instead. “And you know what? I did,” Burnham says. He got better. “So much better, in fact, that in January of 2020, I thought, ‘You know what, I should start performing again.’” He’d been a kind of recluse.

Let’s take another look, as modern paleoanthropologists have, at the Taung child’s skull, one of paleontology’s most famous fossils, the remains of a child from the species, Australopithecus africanus, discovered in 1924. A reanalysis of the Taung child, DeSilva tells us, showed talon marks in its eye sockets. “A bird of prey, probably a crowned eagle, must have plucked the Taung child from the ground and carried it off to be eaten.” See, I told you.

Over the last 20 years, genomics, ancient DNA, and paleoanthropology have joined forces to completely overhaul our understanding of the origin of our species. The true diversity and complexity of human evolution over the last few hundred millennia surpasses even the most unhinged imaginings we might have hazarded just a short generation ago. But greater clarity has left us with a messier and less elegant narrative. Our species’ status, it turns out, is “complicated.”\nIn the year 2000, the orthodoxy was that humans spread across the world 60,000 years ago, and were descended exclusively from a small population in Africa.

The greater mystery is that the universe is actually capable of self-comprehension.\nFrom a time nearly 14 billion years ago when all matter and energy existed in an exquisitely uniform and boring state, the cosmos has evolved to contain complex structures that—in at least one tiny spot in our solar system—have gained myste…",

I develop an argument that challenges the common sense attitudes towards self-sacrificial altruism in typical, paradigmatic cases. I consider SSA involving sacrificing one’s life for other human beings, focusing, for the sake of simplicity, on saving a single person. We have reasons to think that many paradigmatic acts of SSA may, on reflection, be irrational, that typical moral heroes are mistaken, that dispositional self-sacrificers should perhaps resist their good urges to keep saving people, and that the enchantments of heroism should regularly be resisted.",

          "description": "There is widespread agreement that coercive force may be used to prevent people from seriously and wrongfully harming others. But what about when those others are non-human animals? Some militant animal rights activists endorse the use of violent coercion against those who would otherwise harm animals. In the philosophical literature on animal ethics, however, theirs is a stance that enjoys little direct support. I contend that such coercion is nevertheless prima facie morally permissible. I defend this contention by arguing (a) that from the point of view of common sense morality, it is prima facie permissible to use coercive force to prevent puppies from being wrongfully mutilated and (b) that this point clearly extends to other kinds of animals and to other kinds of seriously harmful practices. I then show that there is, as a result of (b), presumptive moral justification for some of the highly controversial instances of direct action undertaken by the Animal Liberation Front and similar groups of militant animal rights activists. I close by arguing that pragmatic considerations override most proposals to undertake direct action, even when the proposed actions are prima facie morally permissible. Indeed, I conclude that although the use of violent coercion to prevent harm to animals may occasionally be ultima facie permissible, its use is in tension with (and tends to undermine) the broader agenda of the animal rights movement.",

          "description": "“Cognitive creationism” is a term for ideologically based rejection of concepts from differential psychology or behavioral genetics. Various authors have compared this practice to young-Earth creationism, but the parallels between the two have not previously been subjected to an in-depth comparison, which is conducted for the first time in this paper. Both views are based on a similar set of psychological needs, and both have developed epistemologically similar worldviews, which draw certain conclusions ahead of time and then interpret all evidence in light of these assumptions. This reversal of the scientific method leads both young-Earth creationists and cognitive creationists to reject large swaths of otherwise well-established research due to its potential to support conclusions they have chosen a priori to reject. Both views also tend to rely on nonparsimonious ad hoc explanations, which are usually not able to reliably predict any future results. The risks posed by cognitive creationism will be discussed, along with potential implications for science education.",

          "description": "Wearing black make-up to impersonate black individuals has become highly controversial in many countries, even when it is part of long-standing cultural traditions. Prominent examples of such traditions include Saint Nicolas celebrations in the Netherlands (which feature a black character known as “Black Pete” who hands out candy to children), Epiphany parades in Spain (which feature impersonations of the biblical king Balthasar who is traditionally portrayed as black) and the annual Zulu parade in New Orleans (which features impersonations of South African Zulu warriors). In this article, I challenge the widely held view that black make-up traditions are categorically wrong. Specifically, I argue that these traditions can be morally vindicated if (i) the large majority of individuals who help to maintain them do not believe that they denigrate black people; (ii) the relevant traditions do not depict black people in denigrating ways; and (iii) the relevant traditions are not gratuitously offensive. While the Dutch Saint Nicholas tradition fails to satisfy these conditions, the New Orleans Zulu tradition is found to satisfy them, as is the Spanish Epiphany tradition in certain cases. I end by identifying another set of conditions under which black make-up traditions might be morally justified.",

I argue that a point is a valued end and that, as agents, it makes sense for us to want our efforts and enterprises to have a point. Valued ends provide justifying reasons for our acts, efforts, and projects. I further argue that ends lie separate from the acts and enterprises for which they provide a point. Since there can be no end external to one’s entire life since one’s life includes all of one’s ends, leading and living one’s life as a whole cannot have a point. Finally, I argue that since we live our lives and structure our living-a-human-life efforts both in parts and as a whole, it is fitting to be sad to recognize that leading and living a life is pointless. My discussion helps make sense of the literature that frequently talks around this topic but often does so vaguely and indirectly.",

          "description": "The primary aim of this paper is to show that Alex Byrne’s arguments in “Are Women Adult Human Females?” provide no reason to doubt the truth of the proposition that trans women are women. Byrne’s conclusion is that women are adult human females. However, it is safe to say that much of the interest in his article is driven by the assumption that it is a short step from that conclusion to the further conclusion that trans women are not women. If Byrne is understood to be defending that further conclusion, however, then some of his arguments are dialectically ineffective. The others commit an evidential fallacy or rest on a false premise.",

          "description": "Suppose we accept that punishment can be legitimate. What form should it take? Many of us believe that it can be acceptable to fine or imprison someone, but that capital punishment, along with corporal punishment in its various manifestations, is wholly unacceptable. I suggest that it is hard to account for or justify this distinction. But granting that resistance to these latter forms is unlikely to be dislodged, and granting too that imprisonment in particular is hardly problem-free, it is worth considering whether there might be alternatives. And I argue here that we should consider enforced coma as a procedure having many advantages over the more familiar methods of delivering a penalty. Of course, there are disadvantages also. The aim isn’t to offer a detailed and practical solution to the problem of crime, but to explore some of the presumptions and principles involved in our thinking about punishment.",

          "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has engendered unprecedented drastic and costly measures to obviate the threat. Will something similar happen in relation to global heating? No, this is not likely. Mainly this has to do with a difference in the nature of collective action. Nation states protect their respective populations against the virus. With regard to global heating, we are facing the tragedy of the commons. No global government assumes responsibility for our common future. However, there may be another and further explanation lurking behind political inaction: many people, including our politicians, think that it does not matter if humanity goes extinct. It does matter, however. Strangely enough, the view that it matters is questioned by many important philosophers in the past and in the present, and it is hence controversial. Yet, it should be our common-sense stance to the problem. It is of the utmost importance that there will be sentient happy life on the globe for an indefinite time. Theoretically speaking, in order to recognize this, we need to accept some “total” view, implying what has been called the repugnant conclusion. Practically speaking, we should go to great length to rescue our human civilisation, even if this means that, for a while, we must endure all sorts of hardships such as a global enlightened despotism, or worse—a situation of life boat ethics.",

Conditions are especially bad in California and the Southwest, but the drought extends into the Pacific Northwest, much of the Intermountain West, and even the Northern Plains.\nScientists are calling it a \"mega-drought\" brought on by climate change.\nThe latest U.S. Drought Monitor Map shows large areas of the Southwest are \"exceptionally dry,\" the worst category. Lake Mead has dropped so much that it has cut the Hoover dam's hydropower output by nearly 25%.\n\n\nThe persistence of the drought makes this a \"mega drought\" that could last decades.

Bezos is taking Wally Funk to space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket on July 20. But the Financial Times reported that Branson hopes to be aboard a Virgin Galactic flight on July 11, meaning he'd beat the Amazon founder by nine clear days.\nOnly, there's scope for some A-grade pedantry here.\nThere is no single agreed-upon definition of what counts as the point where the Earth's atmosphere ends and space begins. NASA defines space as starting 50 miles above the Earth's surface; the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the governing body for air sports, defines it as 100 kilometers, or 62 miles. Both have a point, neither is agreed upon universally, and picking one over the other causes its own problems.\nAnyway. How high does Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo go? In testing, up to about 56 miles. How high does Blue Origin's New Shephard go? About 62 miles.\nIn other words, Branson might make it up there first. But Bezos may contend that Branson didn't, in fact, make it into space at all.\nWould that be tiresome? Yes. Does it really matter all that much in the grand scheme of things? Not particularly. Will that all stop it from happening? Doubtful. But hey, Elon might have the last laugh when he makes it to Mars.",

          "description": "Like other Americans, I’m depressed by the growing level of political partisanship. There seem to be a lot more people with extreme beliefs yelling at us. The ends of the belief spectrum are engorged, the center hollowed out. It’s frequently alleged that extremists don’t care about truth, that they don’t even believe there’s a distinction between truth and falsehood. But that’s an unhelpful, and philosophically suspect, way of stating what’s wrong with extremism. Most of us think of philosophy as an arcane subject remote from our day-to-day concerns, the playground of navel gazers and other impractical people. But philosophy has a good deal to say about the nature of our beliefs, why some beliefs seem true and others false, why we find it so difficult to convince people to give up deeply held beliefs, and the real problem with extremism. Beliefs as rules of action From René Descartes in the 17th century through Immanuel Kant in the early 19th, philosophers tended to think of beliefs as pictures in the mind; if you believe it’s raining, …",

What began in the mid-1970s as a small group of born-again hippies who played music, prayed together, and proselytized to whoever would listen about Jesus’s unconditional love and mercy, descended into authoritarianism in the 1980s after its founder linked up with the broader charismatic renewal movement that had been sweeping the nation. The Lamb of God’s doctrine became explicit—Christianity good; Islam, feminism, secular humanism, and Marxism bad; and the rules strict—complete submission of all members to the leadership, and of all wives to their husbands. My father was one of the five male leaders, or “coordinators.” My mother, though she had at one time been considered for the corresponding female role of “handmaid,” was never officially appointed to the position. This meant that she was excluded from the leadership’s official meetings, segregated by sex, in which coordinators and handmaids would discuss the goings-on of their underlings—who was having marital problems, who was doubting the faith, who …",

How much better for us if all humans died in costly nursing homes amid doctors who lie, nurses who lie, friends who lie…” ~CS Lewis in The Screwtape Letters   Watching the West hesitate over the end of COVID restrictions, attempting to judge the trade-off between living life as normal and the number of deaths that would result from that, has brought new clarity to a concept that had previously lurked just below the surface of consciousness; modern societies are bad at handling the fundamental fact of individual mortality. You are going to die. That much was guaranteed when you were born. That we don’t like to think about this fact—categorise death as something that happens to other people, out of sight and out of mind—does not alter it.

Feynman, The Character of Physical Law   On June 25th, the Office of the US Director of National Intelligence created a national stir by releasing a long awaited, if short, nine-page unclassified report entitled, “Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.” It was created under the direction of the Intelligence Authorization act of 2021 to assess the threat posed by unidentified areal phenomena, and the results of the Department of Defense Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) effort to understand this threat.

They let me know that I mattered to them, they praised when praise was due, and they pushed me hard. Often I balked, and they continued to push. Indeed, the teachers who sternly, even at times angrily, called me out on my intellectual arrogance and sloppiness became mentors and, in several cases, lifelong friends. I think of one in particular, an English teacher to whom I’d brought a piece of freshman writing I’d ginned up only minutes before a mandatory conference. I knew it was junk when I carried it to his desk. He stunned me, growling, “You get the hell out of this office. And don’t come back until you respect yourself and me enough to do serious work.” The upshot—I admired his refusal of my bullshit. I went on to take all his classes. Today, such a teacher would be subject, at least, to sensitivity training …",

Having become a martyr of hyper-progressive ideological mania, Weinstein resigned, sued, won, starred in a documentary about the experience, and embarked upon a new career as a podcaster. Since then, Weinstein has become both a symbol and a voice for millions of Americans, on the Left and Right alike, who are unnerved that a handful of Silicon Valley oligopolists have acquired the power to set the boundaries of acceptable speech, if not formally, then effectively. Weinstein has become an influential public figure, with 350,000 subscribers on YouTube. Many consider his voice a credible one in life-and-death debates about the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, Weinstein has graduated from entertaining theories that might not be right but could do no harm, to theories that cannot be right and are sure to do harm. Because of …",

Sixty years ago, however, it was viewed quite differently. Scientology—or dianetics, as it was originally known—was an appealing idea to many intellectuals and creatives at a time when the world was rapidly changing and notions that had once been taken for granted were suddenly being tossed out of the window. In science, art, and philosophy, accepted norms were being turned on their heads, and in the 1950s and ’60s, L. Ron Hubbard’s ideas—peddled as an alternative to psychiatry—fit quite nicely among the emerging doctrines dreamed up by his contemporary thinkers. Indeed, the original concepts that launched Hubbard’s movement were not as outrageous as those that define it today. Among these, the idea of “engrams” and the “reactive mind” were perhaps the most appealing. Hubbard theorised that humans are marked by unconscious …",

It is a writer’s job to point out how words become flabby through overuse (such is the visceral aversion to cliché), but that is an elitist’s grievance. More telling is the way in which “narrative” has lately acquired the flavor of a pejorative. The popular connotation, in this case, is one that encourages suspicion. For example, Eric Weinstein likes to refer to what he calls the “Gated Institutional Narrative” (a coinage he uses to indict the insular bias and self-protecting interests of newspapers like the New York Times) to describe a false sense of reality, supported by a phony consensus that is held in place (often in bad faith) by …",

Neither would we have understood why decrying one form of bigotry without mentioning another is problematic.

At work, many Americans settled into their new daily routines of working from home, hunched over computer screens for hours of caffeine-supported Zoom calls frequently followed by app-delivered box dinners. In elementary schools throughout the country, young children began growing accustomed to wearing masks while sitting in socially distanced cubicles to learn about the dangers of hugging, shaking hands, or breaking social distancing protocols. In organs of government, state governors around the country invoked various emergency measures to help better curtail nonconforming human behaviour; from doling out stiff fines and penalties to non-compliant small business owners, to offering monetary incentives for snitching on one’s own neighbors, to surveilling parks and beaches with aerial drones, to conducting police raids on non-socially-distanced children’s birthday parties, to imposing $1,000 fines for those citizens refusing to wear a mask.

Frankly, the file is thin. Generally, scholars engage with her important body of work (more than 60 books, fiction and non-fiction), without mentioning this topic. It is an interesting footnote, no more. Why interesting? Because it illustrates, in her case and as a pattern, how an inquiring mind sincerely committed to human rights and democratic values can turn off its critical antennae. Atwood allowed herself to become a compliant guest in a country that checks almost all the boxes of totalitarianism, minus extensive terror: a single-party state, no rule of law, arbitrary arrests (2,000 of them during the first eight months of last year), stultifying media (even Raúl Castro says so), and a regime of censorship …",

Media and popular culture are saturated with concerns over “fake news,” alternative facts and conspiracy theories. There is widespread concern over the breakdown of integrity and trust in public figures and experts, the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between true and false claims, and the increasing willingness of predators to prey upon this difficulty. Passions flare, political sides polarise, and neither side seems capable of talking or listening to the other. It is therefore a great irony that many of those most worried about these developments also deny the possibility of absolute truth, without recognising any connection between the two. Certain assumptions about the relative nature of truth are represented, for instance, by the increasing public focus on “perspective” or “social privilege,” with the assumption that identity or experience drastically limits or determines understanding. Under this assumption, each group possesses its own, or perhaps the whole, truth about matters relating to their lives: “You cannot truly know this because you …",

It’s become like a Groundhog Day, set in late March 2020. In recent weeks community transmission has returned after leaks from hotel quarantine. This has led risk-averse state governments to reintroduce stay-at-home orders: first in Melbourne, and now in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Townsville, and the Gold Coast. Australia’s vaccination rate is at the bottom of the OECD’s 38 advanced economies.

What happens in any part of the world affects all other countries.”\nWhy it matters: The spread of the variant has somewhat dampened hopes for a rapid economic rebound. \n\nThe International Monetary Fund has said it still expects the economy to grow at the 6% rate it projected earlier this year, but warned that the variant is threatening growth to developing nations with less access to vaccines.",

          "description": "Reproduced from Pew Research Center; Chart: Axios visuals\nTwo-thirds of American churches delivered overtly political sermons or messages in the run-up to the 2020 election, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of online sermons.\nWhy it matters: Many clergy felt compelled to address the controversies dividing the country — and possibly their own congregations — at a time of turmoil. \n\nBy the numbers: Between Aug.31 and Nov. 8, 2020, two-thirds of churches posted at least one sermon or message about the 2020 election. The messages varied among Christian churches: \n\n48% of sermons mentioning the election in evangelical Protestant churches discussed specific issues, parties or candidates. Evangelical pastors were more than twice as likely as others to use the phrases \"Satan,\" \"hell\" and \"pray [for our] president.\"\nHistorically Black Protestant pastors were far more likely to encourage voting and turnout, and to reference voter suppression, more than other groups.\n\nWhen discussing racism, evangelical pastors disproportionately leaned on phrases such as \"racial tension.\" Evangelicals also used terms like \"police officer,\" \"crime\" and \"convict\" around three times as often as others. \n\nPastors in mainline and historically Black Protestant congregations used terms like \"anti-racism\" and \"white supremacist\" when talking about racism.\n\nMeanwhile, Catholic priests were least likely to discuss any of these topics during services.\nDetails: The analysis of 12,832 sermons, shared online by 2,143 churches (due to the pandemic), is not necessarily a representative sample of all sermons delivered across the country. \n\nIt provides a glimpse of the messages that churchgoers heard during a pivotal period for the U.S.",

As long as we are weak, I think we will need our neighbors.\"\n\nInterim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said in an interview with ABC News on Saturday that police had \"the right people\" in custody and revealed that Moïse was \"tortured\" before he was killed.\n\nWhat they're saying:  The State Department said in a statement Axios on Friday that the Haitian government \"has requested security and investigative assistance, and we remain in regular contact with Haitian officials to discuss how the United States can assist.\"\nWhat to watch: White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday the U.S. will send federal law enforcement officers to aid in the investigation.\n\nSenior officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security will travel to Port-au-Prince \"as soon as possible\" to \"assess the situation and how we may be able to assist,\" Psaki said.\nThe White House will also send coronavirus vaccines to Haiti as early as next week, according to Psaki.\nHaitian officials have also reached out to the United Nations about sending peacekeeping forces, Reuters reports.\n\nThe big picture: 2o suspects have been detained over the assassination, which also wounded Martine Moïse, Joseph said.\n\nThe assassination comes amid increasing political turmoil and gang violence in Port-au-Prince as inflation and a delayed election contribute to the state of crisis in the Western Hemisphere's most impoverished nation. \n\nGo deeper: Coup claim deepens Haiti's political crisis\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with additional information throughout.",

With the pandemic, they are overwhelmed.\n\nPartly to blame are the enduring consequences of diverted funds, since Latin American and Caribbean nations consistently rank as some of the most corrupt in the world.",

That’s going to change.\"\nDriving the news: The account appears in a closely held book that'll be out Tuesday, \"An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination,\" by the N.Y. Times' Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang.\n\nThe group, the authors write, \"had endured eighteen months of one bad news cycle after another. They had been forced to defend Facebook to their friends, family, and angry employees. Most of them had little to do with the controversies over election disinformation and Cambridge Analytica.\"\n\nThe book says Zuckerberg had been influenced by ideas in \"What You Do Is Who You Are,\" by Ben Horowitz — who's half of Andreessen Horowitz, the VC firm that invested early in Facebook, along with Marc Andreessen, Zuckerberg’s friend and a Facebook board member: \n\nHorowitz argues that at various stages of development, tech companies demand two kinds of CEOs: wartime and peacetime leaders. In periods of peace, he writes, a company can focus on expanding and reinforcing its strengths. In times of war, the threats are existential, and the company has to hunker down to fight for survival. \n... \nFrom that day forward, Zuckerberg continued, he was taking on the role of wartime CEO. He would assume more direct control over all aspects of the business. He could no longer sequester himself to focus only on new products. More decisions would fall to him. \nFacebook tells Axios that Zuckerberg instructed leaders they’d have to be more decisive, and would need to move forward even when there wasn't a clear consensus. His view was that it was like wartime, and he needed to run the company as a wartime CEO.\nGo deeper: Read a N.Y. Times adaptation.",

It asks several agencies to \"update guidelines on banking mergers to provide more robust scrutiny of mergers.\"\nThe bottom line: None of this changes actual antitrust law, to which judges remain beholden.

What's notable is that lately, the White House has been getting much more vocal about the CES.\nLast Tuesday top aides Gina McCarthy and Anita Dunn listed it among the priorities, and on Wednesday McCarthy called it one of the \"bottom lines\" for the reconciliation plan.\nBiden's speech on Wednesday may be the first time he's publicly name-checked the policy since it was included in the big infrastructure wish-list the White House released in March.\n\nThe intrigue: How exactly backers will craft a plan to comply with reconciliation, which is designed for spending and revenue measures.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reports that Democrats may set annual clean power targets for utilities to hit.\n\"If utilities hit these targets, they would get financial support from the federal government.

          "description": "America's public schools are ready for a return to classrooms this fall, but virtual learning still isn't going away.\nWhat's happening: Whether to accommodate some families or cover for teacher shortages, many schools are holding onto remote classes for the fall. But much more than remote work, remote learning has been littered with problems and inequities.\n\nBy the numbers: At the end of the 2020–21 school year, only about 2% of K–12 students in the U.S. were attending virtual-only schools, and 70% were in traditional, in-person schools, according to the Burbio School Opening Tracker.\n\nA sizable chunk — 28% — were in hybrid schools, which has typically meant some days in the classroom and some days at home.\n\nHybrid in a post-pandemic world will mean in-person school for most students with …",

Because of his terrible record.”\nMLB declined to comment. \n\nThe big picture:  In April, Manfred announced that the 2021 All-Star Game would be moved out of Atlanta due to Georgia's law curbing voting access, a move the President Joe Biden said he would support.\n\nThe decision to move the game to Denver was heavily criticized by Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. \nA Texas-based conservative organization, the Job Creator Network, tried to sue MLB, but the suit was dismissed by a federal judge, who called the lawsuit “weak and muddled.”\nCritics of the Georgia law claim it was intended to target heavily Democratic jurisdictions and will hurt Black and Latino voters the most.\n\nGo deeper: Conservative groups have been trying to “name and shame” organizations for their perceived partisan positions, often attempting to influence the C-Suite by buying ads on CNBC, the network many executives watch\n\nIn May, Consumers' Research launched a similar seven-figure campaign against Coca-Cola, American Airlines and Nike. \nThe new ads against MLB and Ticketmaster are scheduled for cable and local TV where the companies are headquartered, as well as in Atlanta, where the decision to move the game to Denver was criticized by local business leaders.",

The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince issued a security alert calling on staff to avoid unnecessary travel in the area.\nWhat they're saying: Joseph condemned what he called an \"inhumane and barbaric act,\" adding: \"The country's security situation is under the control of the National Police of Haiti and the Armed Forces of Haiti. Democracy and the republic will win.\"\n\nJoseph said the \"highly coordinated\" attack was carried out by a \"highly trained and heavily armed group\" at around 1am on July 7. He called on the international community to launch an investigation, and for the United Nations Security Council to hold a meeting on Haiti as soon as possible.\n\"We urge Haitians to show restraint and maintain a peaceful environment over the coming days,\" Joseph said.\n\nThe big picture: The violence comes amid increasing political instability in Haiti and calls for Moïse's removal from office before his term ended. Gang violence has spiked significantly in the capital of Port-au-Prince as the country continues to grapple with poverty and a cycle of delayed election.\nGo deeper: Coup claim deepens Haiti's political crisis",
