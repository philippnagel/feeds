Roblox has come up as a contentious topic in the Epic Games v. Apple trial as well.\nBut it’s also just an astonishingly popular app: 42.1 million people play Roblox daily. And its popularity is surging during the pandemic. Daily active users were up 85 percent in 2020, compared to the year before.\nUntil recently, though, I didn’t really understand what Roblox actually was, despite the app having been around since 2006.

          "description": "One of the great insights of modern growth theory -- Paul Romer's Nobel Prize -- is that ideas are the foundation of economic growth. Ideas are also \"nonrivial.\" If you use my car, I can't use it, but if you use our family recipe for road-oil chocolate cake (yum), we can still enjoy it as much as ever. Once an idea has been had, economics says it should be used as widely as possible as soon as possible  \nBut coming up with ideas is expensive. And aside patent protections, I can't charge for the benefit to you of my new ideas.  So, economists naturally notice the mother of all public goods. Research -- finding new ideas --  has enormous benefits, and people will not naturally devote enough resources to finding, refining, implementing new ideas. So, economists conclude,  the government shoul…",

You might think finance would be an exception to the growing political monoculture in US academia.

The we-should-be-more-like-Europe crowd has some explaining to do. (The Word Bank's software misplaced the UK label; it is the red line on the top of the European group.) From the World Bank, HT Marginal Revolution.\nThe graph is in dollars, so part of the effect is that the dollar got more valuable relative to the euro. (Thanks to the commenters who noticed that I misread the graph caption. Blog post now fixed to reflect that.) \n\nUpdate\nA correspondent sends along the following graph from IMF data. IMF data uses PPP adjustments, not straight conversion to dollars. So the exchange rate really is an issue in comparing US to EU growth.  \n\n\nRelative inflation has not been that different between the two countries. \n\n\nAt least by these measures, EU inflation has been only very slightly less than US inflation \nSo indeed, the exchange rate is the major part of the difference between the two graphs. Whether PPP or actual exchange rates are \"right\" for this purpose I leave for another day. Certainly the average American's ability to buy European goods has risen relative to the average European's ability to buy American goods. Why exchange rates diverge so long from PPP measures remains, I think, a central puzzle. But thanks to blog readers for quickly pointing out that the Marginal Revolution graph isn't as immediately relevant as it seemed.",

A famous economist advised me to give up studying inflation -- inflation is 2%, he said, that's all you need to know. Apparently a new constant of nature. \nWell, apparently not. Inflation can happen, and there is an economics of inflation.

Sure \"net interest margin\" or other metrics might not look good, but money is money and more money is more money. \nThe answer: \n\nTop of mind for many big banks is a rule requiring them to hold [sic] capital equivalent to at least 3% of all assets.

          "description": "Three years ago, the Atlanta Hawks traded Luka Doncic to Dallas in exchange for Trae Young and the right to draft Cam Reddish. Over the next three years, there was an almost universal view among NBA basketball fans that the trade was very lopsided, with Atlanta losing badly.\nLast night, Atlanta was eliminated from the playoffs. Nonetheless, one TV commentator suggested that the trade now looks much more even. Young was spectacular in the playoffs before getting hurt a week ago, and while it’s too soon to fully judge Reddish, he looked very good in a couple playoff games after coming off an injury. Atlanta went much further in the playoffs than Dallas.\nThis example demonstrates something I’ve noticed quite often. People are far too quick to make judgments. Pundits that focus on the economy …",

          "description": "Except if remuneration—the price of labor—is capped by government, there can be no more shortage of labor than a shortage of, say, steel. As is currently the case, labor can become more expensive like car rentals have become; it could be very expensive, like BMWs, if demand were even higher compared to supply. But if a market price obtains at which as much as one wants is available, speaking of a shortage is a confusing use of language. Indeed, it is precisely because a non-government-controlled price can rise, thereby reducing quantity demanded and increasing quantity supplied, that there is no shortage. (See my econlog post “Don’t Confuse Shortage and Smurfage.”)\nWhen an employer says he cannot get the labor he needs, he is typically trying to say (assuming that remuneration is determine…",
