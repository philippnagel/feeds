          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",
