The cell phone must have the NFC chip and the option should be activated!\n2. You must a have a QR reader app installed or you can install it now after activating the NFC option! You must then proceed to install the Portuguese Post Office CTT app for which a QR is provided in the last photo (green colour) or manually install the free app from App or playstore and its called: CTT Filatelia\n\n\n\n3. Now open the app.....then bring your cell phone in very close proximity to the stamp for the \"chip\" to activate the desired effect or activate the passive content on the stamp!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view other stamps in this category click on the following link - \nStamps with NFC technology\nMiniature Sheets with Materials Affixed \nDisclaimer - Information about the stamp issues on this page has been taken from the net and is for informational purposes only.

But where gains \r\nstem from changes in the price of an asset – and are only realized when the \r\nasset is sold – yield is a measure of cash flows generated and distributed \r\nto the asset’s holder. While they are separate phenomena, yield informs the \r\nprice of an asset and vice versa. Element is a protocol that allows \r\ndevelopers and investors to harness the power of yield in their \r\napplications and strategies.",

This followup offers some suggestions for what to do about it.\nWe can think of firefighting as a multi-stage process that starts with a source of ignition that then progresses all the way into containment of large scale fires and evacuation of entire settlements. Accordingly at each stage there are multiple things one could do. Importantly there is no silver bullet against wildfires, and moreover there is no clever technical way to fight them: the bulk of the response is going to be \"more and better of the same\".\nThe presence of wildfires in California is not a problem that given enough resources could be solved within reason (By solved meaning ~0 uncontrolled fires occurring) as the tradeoffs invol…",

But it’s possible Intel’s negotiating with the investment firm that owns GlobalFoundries instead, as the WSJ points out.

Link here in case the above embed does not work. Paper here, (with Jose Luis Cruz Alvarez), slides here. Previous introductory post here. \nThere is a lot in this paper and presentation, and I'm going to try to stick to one topic per post. \nLike most economists, my knee jerk reaction to climate change is \"carbon tax.\" In particular, a carbon tax instead of extensive regulation. Given that we're going to have a climate policy that discourages carbon emissions, a uniform price on carbon emissions is the only sensible and effective way to do it. (Whether tax, tradeable rights, or other mechanism doesn't matter for this purpose.) I would add r…",

As we prepare to spend trillions and trillions of dollars on climate change, this certainly seems like the important question that economists should have good answers for. I'm looking in to what anyone actually knows about these questions. The answer is surprisingly little, and it seems a ripe area for research. This post begins a series.  \nI haven't gotten deep in this issue before, because of a set of overriding facts and logical problems. I don't see how these will change, but the question frames my investigation. \nAn illogical question\nThe economic effects of climate change are dwarfed by growth. \nTake even worst-case estimates that climate c…",

Ideas are also \"nonrivial.\" If you use my car, I can't use it, but if you use our family recipe for road-oil chocolate cake (yum), we can still enjoy it as much as ever. Once an idea has been had, economics says it should be used as widely as possible as soon as possible  \nBut coming up with ideas is expensive. And aside patent protections, I can't charge for the benefit to you of my new ideas.  So, economists naturally notice the mother of all public goods.

You might think finance would be an exception to the growing political monoculture in US academia. You would be mostly wrong.  \nEmre Kuvvet tracked down the party affiliation of finance professors in the top 20 US departments, and wrote up the results in \"Even Finance Professors Lean Left. \n\n\nBerkeley has more Republicans than Chicago? I think numbers are low because so many faculty are not US citizens. It's initially striking  how many finance faculty are not even registered to vote, but I suspect that this reflects the large number of non-US citizens in finance departments. \n\n\nHere come the millennials... Or, maybe Churchill was right about hearts and brains. \nJournal editors: \n\nNot even the JFE can manifest many Republicans! \nOf course this is a striking amount of political diversity by the standards of the rest of most universities.",

These people are famous enough now to have a platform, and so their books look worth doing, financially, but 10 years ago these people would have been taking out ads in the back of the Weekly World News to get people to order their pamphlets on various snake oils.\n\n                        (2 COMMENTS)",

(False)\n3.  Periods of sustained and high rates of inflation are always caused by rapid money growth. (Probably true)\n4.  Inappropriately high inflation is caused by bad monetary policy.  (True)\nDon Patinkin assumed that Milton Friedman had the first interpretation in mind, and criticized the claim for being tautological.  Actually, Friedman had the third interpretation in mind.\nIn my view, policy counterfactuals are the most useful way to think about causality questions related to inflation (and NGDP growth).  If the lowest cost way of preventing high inflation is with monetary policy, then a period of high inflation can be said to be caused by inept monetary policy.  If the lowest cost method of controlling inflation is with restrictive fiscal policy, then overly stimulative fiscal policy can be said to have caused high inflation.  I believe that monetary policy is the lowest cost solution for high inflation (at least in the US).\n                        (0 COMMENTS)",

Nor does it consist in producing the largest value of goods calculated by weighing the quantities produced with any set of prices.

Transit ridership, however, was only 42 percent of pre‐​pandemic levels, which is making transit agencies desperate to justify their future existence and the subsidies they depend on to keep running.\n\nThis is from Randal O’Toole, “Transit’s Dead End,” Cato.org, July 13, 2021.\nBut does that mean that governments are reducing their subsidies to mass transit? Guess again.\nO’Toole points out the basic problem with mass transit in the United States, almost all of which is run by, or heavily subsidized by, governments:\nTransit’s real problem is that it is operating a nineteenth‐​century business model in twenty‐​first century cities. In 1890, when American cities were rapidly installing electric streetcars, most urban jobs were downtown and the streetcar lines radiated away from downtown hubs to bring people to work.\nToday, only about 8 percent of jobs are in downtowns, and large urban areas such as Los Angeles or Houston have numerous job centers with as many and often more jobs than the traditional downtowns. Yet, in most urban areas, transit still has a hub‐​and‐​spoke system centered around the central city downtown. Demographer Wendell Cox’s analysis of census data show that, before the pandemic, transit carried about 40 percent of downtown commuters to work, but typically carried only about 5 percent of commuters to other major job centers.\n\n \n \n \n                        (2 COMMENTS)",

It was cancer, and not the first time that accursed murderer has taken someone from me much too soon. Steve was much too young, only 57, and he would have gotten a kick out of living in a world where the notion of 57 as too young is a thing. Truthfully, he did get a kick out of living in such a world, and he did everything within his not insignificant power to spread and share his sense of wonder and joy.\nI am not really writing an elegy here.

In it, he addressed an earlier comment by Liam:\nJohn’s child is dying from cancer. He cannot afford to fly her to a country offering pioneering treatment. Let’s assume it has a reasonably high chance of saving her life. Can John hack into Bill Gates’ bank account and steal the money he needs?\nI take it that Caplan thinks this would be wrong; and yet what could possibly be more demanding than a moral principle which requires you to step back and watch your own child die from cancer? In fact, utilitarianism would probably be less demanding in this case, since you may well increase overall utility by stealing the money.\n\nBryan answered:\nActually, I don’t think this would be wrong.  Like Huemer, I endorse a moderate deontological view that allows rights violations when the benefits vastly exceed the costs.\n\nI was shocked.\nIf Bryan thinks it’s right to steal from Bill Gates to finance expensive cancer surgery with “a reasonably high chance of saving her life,” then that principle must apply to tens of millions of people who could have their lives saved even more cheaply by being able to get food.\nThink of, say, 100 million of the poorest people in India. They could ward off starvation for a year or even two with an extra $1,000. That’s $100 billion, which is enough to wipe out Bill Gates’ net worth, especially after Melinda is done with him.\nThat seems wrong to me. How few people have to benefit from stealing  from Bill Gates to make it right to steal? 10 million? 1 million? 10?\nWorking backward, it seems wrong to me for even one poor parent in India to steal from Bill Gates.\n \n                        (3 COMMENTS)",

Other writers have noticed that children seem to have far less unstructured play time than they once did. Many parents of a certain age have noted the prevalence of peanut allergies in children, a condition barely even heard of when they – ok, we – were young. What ties all these things together?

Nonetheless, one TV commentator suggested that the trade now looks much more even. Young was spectacular in the playoffs before getting hurt a week ago, and while it’s too soon to fully judge Reddish, he looked very good in a couple playoff games after coming off an injury. Atlanta went much further in the playoffs than Dallas.\nThis example demonstrates something I’ve noticed quite often. People are far too quick to make judgments. Pundits that focus on the economy …",

But if a market price obtains at which as much as one wants is available, speaking of a shortage is a confusing use of language. Indeed, it is precisely because a non-government-controlled price can rise, thereby reducing quantity demanded and increasing quantity supplied, that there is no shortage.

Among his many contributions was an attempt to prove by logical means the existence of God, which came to be known as Pascal’s Wager. Stated simply, Pascal reasoned that not believing in God, if there was one, would damn you to eternal suffering. Conversely, believing in God, if there wasn’t one, would cost you little in this life and nothing once you were dead. Therefore, the only sensible course of action was to believe in God.\nWhether or not you find Pascal’s Wager to be theologically compelling, it turns out to be a very useful guide for making decisions under conditions of unresolvable uncertainty. And the major uncertainty that all of us a…",

Philip was 12 years old and a student at a prestigious boarding school in Princeton, New Jersey. One of his assignments was to recite Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven. By the day of the presentation, he had rehearsed the poem dozens of times and could recall it with ease. But this time, as he stood before his classmates, something strange happened.\n Each time he delivered the poem’s famous haunting refrain—“Quoth the Raven ‘Nevermore’ ”—the right side of his mouth quivered. The tremor intensified until, about halfway through the recitation, he fell to the floor in convulsions, having lost all control of his body, including bladder and bowels, in front of an audience of merciless adolescents.

Without someone to fight for it, to put error on the defensive, truth may languish. It may even be lost, at least for some time. No one understood this better than the renowned Italian scientist Galileo Galilei.\nIt is easy to imagine the man who for a while almost single-handedly founded the methods and practices of modern science as some sort of Renaissance ivory-tower intellectual, uninterested and unwilling to sully himself by getting down into the trenches in defense of science. But Galileo was not only a relentless advocate for what science could teach the rest of us.

Let’s take another look, as modern paleoanthropologists have, at the Taung child’s skull, one of paleontology’s most famous fossils, the remains of a child from the species, Australopithecus africanus, discovered in 1924. A reanalysis of the Taung child, DeSilva tells us, showed talon marks in its eye sockets. “A bird of prey, probably a crowned eagle, must have plucked the Taung child from the ground and carried it off to be eaten.” See, I told you.

But greater clarity has left us with a messier and less elegant narrative.

          "description": "The deep sea is a part of our planet unlike any other. Accounting for over 95 percent of Earth’s living space, it is cold, dark, and under extreme pressure, yet an astounding variety of creatures abound.\nAlthough relatively little is known about the biology and behavior of animals in the deep sea—defined as beginning at 650 feet down, where sunlight ceases to penetrate, and stretching to the bottom of trenches nearly 7 miles below the ocean’s surface—our ability to observe and study them has never been greater. Over the past half-century, the development of remotely operated vehicles, deep-sea cameras, and deep-submergence vehicles have made it possible for people to get up close and personal with the squishy, spiny, fluorescent, and fantastical residents of this mysterious world.\nIn recen…",

It showed the power of a grassroots movement to spur the government and Big Pharma to action. But it had a dangerous and lasting side effect.Photograph by Cagkan Sayin / Shutterstock\nThree decades ago, a small group from within the AIDS activist organization ACT UP changed the course of medicine in the United States. They employed what they called “the outside/inside strategy.” The activists staged large, noisy demonstrations outside the Food and Drug Administration and other federal government agencies, demanding an acceleration of the drug-approval process. Others learned the minutiae of the science and worked quietly with receptive bureaucrats, bringing the patient’s perspective to the tabl…",

          "description": "It’s hard to argue with the famously authoritative Oxford English Dictionary, but its definition of physics as the “branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of non-living matter and energy” is incomplete because physics studies living things as well. Physicists reported biological research at their first international meeting in 1900, and physics and math still help biologists understand living things.\nIn a striking reverse connection, in the 1940s Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrödinger, founders of relativistic and quantum physics, respectively, projected that tackling questions of biological importance could also enhance physics. They were right: Today researchers are exploring “information” as more than a vaguely defined idea. Instead it has become a specific and unifyi…",

They might be aggressive breast cancers. They might be glioblastomas, one of the deadliest brain tumors that rob patients of their ability to speak or read as they crowd out normal cells. Or they might be pancreatic cancers, the fast and vicious slayers that can overtake a healthy person within weeks or even days.\nThese tiny tumor chunks are transparent and bland—they look like little droplets of hair gel that accidentally plopped into a plastic dish and took hold.

Biology can be reduced to chemistry, chemistry can be reduced to atomic physics, and atoms are made of elementary particles like electrons, quarks, and gluons. The currently known 25 elementary particles might again be made of yet-to-be found smaller entities—most of my colleagues in particle physics certainly think so.

It’s all of the information we utilize and propagate, along with ourselves, through time and space. It’s not encoded in our genes but it’s clearly heritable. I can read a copy of a text from 1,000 years ago and it has stayed intact all that time. Money, too, now circulates through corporations and institutions that deal with information as their primary resource. The dataome is the correlation and dissemination of information or misinformation that has swamped us.

(What he actually said, in his 1936 work “Physics and Reality,” is more longwinded, and includes a digression into Immanuel Kant and the meaning of “comprehensibility,” but he does write “... the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.”) In truth, this statement holds back a little. The greater mystery is that the universe is actually capable of self-comprehension.\nFrom a time nearly 14 billion years ago when all matter and energy existed in an exquisitely uniform and boring state, the cosmos has evolved to contain complex structures that—in at least one tiny spot in our solar system—have gained myste…",

One commented, “I don’t understand; do you hate men?” Another said, “I feel bad for your sons.”\nIt turns out that many people—even some in my progressive, liberal bubble—resist the idea of men becoming feminist dads because they think feminism is inherently “emasculating.” They mistakenly imagine that the move toward gender equality requires a devaluation of manhood. According to the Pew Research Center, 28 percent of men and 17 percent of women in the United States think that “women’s gains have come at the expense of men.”1\nMen are socialized to put down other men by attacking their manhood.\n This flawed critique of feminism is often expressed through crude ca…",

Sehr viel ist ihm bislang nicht gelungen, weder zu Hause noch in Europa, von den militärischen Engagements wie in Mali ganz zu schweigen. Konnte er 2017 im zweiten Wahlgang noch die große Mehrheit der republikanisch gesinnten Franzosen hinter sich vereinen, spürt nun seine mutmaßlich erneute Hauptkonkurrentin Marine Le Pen Rückenwind. Ihr gelingt die „Entdämonisierung“ ihrer zwischen Rechtspopulismus und Rechtsextremismus lavierenden Partei Rassemblement National zunehmend besser.",

I develop an argument that challenges the common sense attitudes towards self-sacrificial altruism in typical, paradigmatic cases. I consider SSA involving sacrificing one’s life for other human beings, focusing, for the sake of simplicity, on saving a single person. We have reasons to think that many paradigmatic acts of SSA may, on reflection, be irrational, that typical moral heroes are mistaken, that dispositional self-sacrificers should perhaps resist their good urges to keep saving people, and that the enchantments of heroism should regularly be resisted.",

          "description": "There is widespread agreement that coercive force may be used to prevent people from seriously and wrongfully harming others. But what about when those others are non-human animals? Some militant animal rights activists endorse the use of violent coercion against those who would otherwise harm animals. In the philosophical literature on animal ethics, however, theirs is a stance that enjoys little direct support. I contend that such coercion is nevertheless prima facie morally permissible. I defend this contention by arguing (a) that from the point of view of common sense morality, it is prima facie permissible to use coercive force to prevent puppies from being wrongfully mutilated and (b) that this point clearly extends to other kinds of animals and to other kinds of seriously harmful practices. I then show that there is, as a result of (b), presumptive moral justification for some of the highly controversial instances of direct action undertaken by the Animal Liberation Front and similar groups of militant animal rights activists. I close by arguing that pragmatic considerations override most proposals to undertake direct action, even when the proposed actions are prima facie morally permissible. Indeed, I conclude that although the use of violent coercion to prevent harm to animals may occasionally be ultima facie permissible, its use is in tension with (and tends to undermine) the broader agenda of the animal rights movement.",

Various authors have compared this practice to young-Earth creationism, but the parallels between the two have not previously been subjected to an in-depth comparison, which is conducted for the first time in this paper. Both views are based on a similar set of psychological needs, and both have developed epistemologically similar worldviews, which draw certain conclusions ahead of time and then interpret all evidence in light of these assumptions. This reversal of the scientific method leads both young-Earth creationists and cognitive creationists to reject large swaths of otherwise well-established research due to its potential to support conclusions they have chosen a priori to reject. Both views also tend to rely on nonparsimonious ad hoc explanations, which are usually not able to reliably predict any future results. The risks posed by cognitive creationism will be discussed, along with potential implications for science education.",

          "description": "Wearing black make-up to impersonate black individuals has become highly controversial in many countries, even when it is part of long-standing cultural traditions. Prominent examples of such traditions include Saint Nicolas celebrations in the Netherlands (which feature a black character known as “Black Pete” who hands out candy to children), Epiphany parades in Spain (which feature impersonations of the biblical king Balthasar who is traditionally portrayed as black) and the annual Zulu parade in New Orleans (which features impersonations of South African Zulu warriors). In this article, I challenge the widely held view that black make-up traditions are categorically wrong. Specifically, I argue that these traditions can be morally vindicated if (i) the large majority of individuals who help to maintain them do not believe that they denigrate black people; (ii) the relevant traditions do not depict black people in denigrating ways; and (iii) the relevant traditions are not gratuitously offensive. While the Dutch Saint Nicholas tradition fails to satisfy these conditions, the New Orleans Zulu tradition is found to satisfy them, as is the Spanish Epiphany tradition in certain cases. I end by identifying another set of conditions under which black make-up traditions might be morally justified.",

I argue that a point is a valued end and that, as agents, it makes sense for us to want our efforts and enterprises to have a point. Valued ends provide justifying reasons for our acts, efforts, and projects. I further argue that ends lie separate from the acts and enterprises for which they provide a point. Since there can be no end external to one’s entire life since one’s life includes all of one’s ends, leading and living one’s life as a whole cannot have a point. Finally, I argue that since we live our lives and structure our living-a-human-life efforts both in parts and as a whole, it is fitting to be sad to recognize that leading and living a life is pointless.

          "description": "Suppose we accept that punishment can be legitimate. What form should it take? Many of us believe that it can be acceptable to fine or imprison someone, but that capital punishment, along with corporal punishment in its various manifestations, is wholly unacceptable. I suggest that it is hard to account for or justify this distinction. But granting that resistance to these latter forms is unlikely to be dislodged, and granting too that imprisonment in particular is hardly problem-free, it is worth considering whether there might be alternatives. And I argue here that we should consider enforced coma as a procedure having many advantages over the more familiar methods of delivering a penalty. Of course, there are disadvantages also. The aim isn’t to offer a detailed and practical solution to the problem of crime, but to explore some of the presumptions and principles involved in our thinking about punishment.",

          "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has engendered unprecedented drastic and costly measures to obviate the threat. Will something similar happen in relation to global heating? No, this is not likely. Mainly this has to do with a difference in the nature of collective action. Nation states protect their respective populations against the virus. With regard to global heating, we are facing the tragedy of the commons. No global government assumes responsibility for our common future. However, there may be another and further explanation lurking behind political inaction: many people, including our politicians, think that it does not matter if humanity goes extinct. It does matter, however. Strangely enough, the view that it matters is questioned by many important philosophers in the past and in the present, and it is hence controversial. Yet, it should be our common-sense stance to the problem. It is of the utmost importance that there will be sentient happy life on the globe for an indefinite time. Theoretically speaking, in order to recognize this, we need to accept some “total” view, implying what has been called the repugnant conclusion. Practically speaking, we should go to great length to rescue our human civilisation, even if this means that, for a while, we must endure all sorts of hardships such as a global enlightened despotism, or worse—a situation of life boat ethics.",

          "description": "Netflix officially threw its hat in the gaming ring on Wednesday, but the move shouldn't have come as much of a surprise. The company's interest in developing and publishing games has been swirling since at least 2018, when it released the interactive \"Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\" special. Since then, Netflix has developed several successful series based on popular video games and even launched Stranger Things games for mobile and the PlayStation VR headset. \nBut news of Netflix's hiring of Oculus VP Mike Verdu, a gaming executive with an impressive track record overseeing mobile game development at companies like Electronic Arts and Zynga, signaled the company was finally serious. We don't know what shape its gaming service will take, but reports peg a launch for 2022 involving a mix of ti…",

          "description": "In June 2020, Zoom had just finished the craziest quarter of its business. While some companies had handed out office stipends or extra time off, Zoom took it a step further. Last summer it gave every employee a special stock grant, with the exception of Zoom's CEO Eric Yuan, who declined the award.\n\nFor U.S. employees, the value was worth roughly $63,000, according to an SEC filing. But thanks to Zoom's stock boom as the pandemic dragged on, the value of those shares has nearly tripled, and are worth around $171,000 today.\nThe goal of the special stock grant was to reward employees who had been under intense pressure during the pandemic, and also to convince them to stick around during a critical time for the business, the SEC filing states. \nAt the time, the value of the 450 shares grant…",

Microsoft says the new emoji are coming to Flipgrid starting today and will come to Teams and Windows later this year, and then onward to Yammer, Outlook and more apps in 2022. \nThe Clippy joke began yesterday with a coy tweet from the Microsoft Twitter account daring users to clear 20,000 likes to bring Clippy back from its digital grave.

NASA defines space as starting 50 miles above the Earth's surface; the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the governing body for air sports, defines it as 100 kilometers, or 62 miles. Both have a point, neither is agreed upon universally, and picking one over the other causes its own problems.\nAnyway. How high does Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo go? In testing, up to about 56 miles. How high does Blue Origin's New Shephard go? About 62 miles.\nIn other words, Branson might make it up there first. But Bezos may contend that Branson didn't, in fact, make it into space at all.\nWould that be tiresome? Yes. Does it really matter all that much in the grand scheme of things? Not particularly. Will that all stop it from happening? Doubtful. But hey, Elon might have the last laugh when he makes it to Mars.",

The good part of this is that employers will be dealing with workers who have more power than before, many fortified by the reflection that, during lockdowns, they kept—and still keep—the medical systems working, the care homes and schools open, the public transport networks moving, the home deliveries arriving, and the social services serving.

After all, the organization that first caught the public’s attention in 1969 was already in its death throes by the early 1970s, beset by internal splits, criminal prosecutions, and violent faction-fighting. Yet, five decades later, the BPP is being energetically romanticized, its legacy is being whitewashed, and its leaders are being valorized in murals, documentaries, and major Hollywood productions that portray the movement and its leaders as revolutionary icons of righteous struggle. The most recent attempt to rehabilitate the BPP began in 2015, when Stanley Nelson’s hagiographic documentary The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution received theatrical distribution, followed by a nationwide PBS broadcast the following year. Notwithstanding a devastating critique by Michael Moynihan in the Daily Beast, the film received a generally favorable critical reception from a credulous media class and was duly followed by further revisionist histories.

As of this month, Bentley University, a business-oriented liberal arts school in Waltham, Mass., will offer a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Sciences degree in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). By all accounts, this is the first undergraduate major dedicated to churning out more diversity bureaucrats and consultants. It will not be the last. The BA track in DEI studies will prepare students for non-profit and community-based work by focusing on “theoretical approaches to social justice,” according to Bentley. The “sciences” track emphasizes the “importance of DEI in organizational strategy,” for students heading into the private sector. Designing the new major was relatively easy, and would be easily replicable at other schools, its architects said. Bentley created just one new “foundational” course, while repackaging Bentley’s existing social justice-themed offerings under the DEI banner. “You may be surprised to find …",

          "description": "Like other Americans, I’m depressed by the growing level of political partisanship. There seem to be a lot more people with extreme beliefs yelling at us. The ends of the belief spectrum are engorged, the center hollowed out. It’s frequently alleged that extremists don’t care about truth, that they don’t even believe there’s a distinction between truth and falsehood. But that’s an unhelpful, and philosophically suspect, way of stating what’s wrong with extremism. Most of us think of philosophy as an arcane subject remote from our day-to-day concerns, the playground of navel gazers and other impractical people. But philosophy has a good deal to say about the nature of our beliefs, why some beliefs seem true and others false, why we find it so difficult to convince people to give up deeply held beliefs, and the real problem with extremism. Beliefs as rules of action From René Descartes in the 17th century through Immanuel Kant in the early 19th, philosophers tended to think of beliefs as pictures in the mind; if you believe it’s raining, …",

What began in the mid-1970s as a small group of born-again hippies who played music, prayed together, and proselytized to whoever would listen about Jesus’s unconditional love and mercy, descended into authoritarianism in the 1980s after its founder linked up with the broader charismatic renewal movement that had been sweeping the nation. The Lamb of God’s doctrine became explicit—Christianity good; Islam, feminism, secular humanism, and Marxism bad; and the rules strict—complete submission of all members to the leadership, and of all wives to their husbands. My father was one of the five male leaders, or “coordinators.” My mother, though she had at one time been considered for the corresponding female role of “handmaid,” was never officially appointed to the position. This meant that she was excluded from the leadership’s official meetings, segregated by sex, in which coordinators and handmaids would discuss the goings-on of their underlings—who was having marital problems, who was doubting the faith, who …",

Men are killed in places where they knew they might be killed and to which they go, if they are at all of the enemy’s party, prepared. How much better for us if all humans died in costly nursing homes amid doctors who lie, nurses who lie, friends who lie…” ~CS Lewis in The Screwtape Letters   Watching the West hesitate over the end of COVID restrictions, attempting to judge the trade-off between living life as normal and the number of deaths that would result from that, has brought new clarity to a concept that had previously lurked just below the surface of consciousness; modern societies are bad at handling the fundamental fact of individual mortality. You are going to die. That much was guaranteed when you were born. That we don’t like to think about this fact—categorise death as something that happens to other people, out of sight and out of mind—does not alter it.

Feynman, The Character of Physical Law   On June 25th, the Office of the US Director of National Intelligence created a national stir by releasing a long awaited, if short, nine-page unclassified report entitled, “Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.” It was created under the direction of the Intelligence Authorization act of 2021 to assess the threat posed by unidentified areal phenomena, and the results of the Department of Defense Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) effort to understand this threat. Put in more popular parlance, it was an official government report about UFOs. The report came almost 74 years to the day after a pilot flying near Mt.

They let me know that I mattered to them, they praised when praise was due, and they pushed me hard. Often I balked, and they continued to push. Indeed, the teachers who sternly, even at times angrily, called me out on my intellectual arrogance and sloppiness became mentors and, in several cases, lifelong friends. I think of one in particular, an English teacher to whom I’d brought a piece of freshman writing I’d ginned up only minutes before a mandatory conference. I knew it was junk when I carried it to his desk. He stunned me, growling, “You get the hell out of this office. And don’t come back until you respect yourself and me enough to do serious work.” The upshot—I admired his refusal of my bullshit. I went on to take all his classes. Today, such a teacher would be subject, at least, to sensitivity training …",

Having become a martyr of hyper-progressive ideological mania, Weinstein resigned, sued, won, starred in a documentary about the experience, and embarked upon a new career as a podcaster. Since then, Weinstein has become both a symbol and a voice for millions of Americans, on the Left and Right alike, who are unnerved that a handful of Silicon Valley oligopolists have acquired the power to set the boundaries of acceptable speech, if not formally, then effectively. Weinstein has become an influential public figure, with 350,000 subscribers on YouTube. Many consider his voice a credible one in life-and-death debates about the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sixty years ago, however, it was viewed quite differently. Scientology—or dianetics, as it was originally known—was an appealing idea to many intellectuals and creatives at a time when the world was rapidly changing and notions that had once been taken for granted were suddenly being tossed out of the window. In science, art, and philosophy, accepted norms were being turned on their heads, and in the 1950s and ’60s, L. Ron Hubbard’s ideas—peddled as an alternative to psychiatry—fit quite nicely among the emerging doctrines dreamed up by his contemporary thinkers. Indeed, the original concepts that launched Hubbard’s movement were not as outrageous as those that define it today. Among these, the idea of “engrams” and the “reactive mind” were perhaps the most appealing. Hubbard theorised that humans are marked by unconscious …",

It is a writer’s job to point out how words become flabby through overuse (such is the visceral aversion to cliché), but that is an elitist’s grievance. More telling is the way in which “narrative” has lately acquired the flavor of a pejorative. The popular connotation, in this case, is one that encourages suspicion. For example, Eric Weinstein likes to refer to what he calls the “Gated Institutional Narrative” (a coinage he uses to indict the insular bias and self-protecting interests of newspapers like the New York Times) to describe a false sense of reality, supported by a phony consensus that is held in place (often in bad faith) by …",

Neither would we have understood why decrying one form of bigotry without mentioning another is problematic.

At work, many Americans settled into their new daily routines of working from home, hunched over computer screens for hours of caffeine-supported Zoom calls frequently followed by app-delivered box dinners. In elementary schools throughout the country, young children began growing accustomed to wearing masks while sitting in socially distanced cubicles to learn about the dangers of hugging, shaking hands, or breaking social distancing protocols. In organs of government, state governors around the country invoked various emergency measures to help better curtail nonconforming human behaviour; from doling out stiff fines and penalties to non-compliant small business owners, to offering monetary incentives for snitching on one’s own neighbors, to surveilling parks and beaches with aerial drones, to conducting police raids on non-socially-distanced children’s birthday parties, to imposing $1,000 fines for those citizens refusing to wear a mask.

Frankly, the file is thin. Generally, scholars engage with her important body of work (more than 60 books, fiction and non-fiction), without mentioning this topic. It is an interesting footnote, no more. Why interesting? Because it illustrates, in her case and as a pattern, how an inquiring mind sincerely committed to human rights and democratic values can turn off its critical antennae. Atwood allowed herself to become a compliant guest in a country that checks almost all the boxes of totalitarianism, minus extensive terror: a single-party state, no rule of law, arbitrary arrests (2,000 of them during the first eight months of last year), stultifying media (even Raúl Castro says so), and a regime of censorship …",

Media and popular culture are saturated with concerns over “fake news,” alternative facts and conspiracy theories. There is widespread concern over the breakdown of integrity and trust in public figures and experts, the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between true and false claims, and the increasing willingness of predators to prey upon this difficulty. Passions flare, political sides polarise, and neither side seems capable of talking or listening to the other. It is therefore a great irony that many of those most worried about these developments also deny the possibility of absolute truth, without recognising any connection between the two. Certain assumptions about the relative nature of truth are represented, for instance, by the increasing public focus on “perspective” or “social privilege,” with the assumption that identity or experience drastically limits or determines understanding. Under this assumption, each group possesses its own, or perhaps the whole, truth about matters relating to their lives: “You cannot truly know this because you …",

It’s become like a Groundhog Day, set in late March 2020. In recent weeks community transmission has returned after leaks from hotel quarantine. This has led risk-averse state governments to reintroduce stay-at-home orders: first in Melbourne, and now in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Townsville, and the Gold Coast. Australia’s vaccination rate is at the bottom of the OECD’s 38 advanced economies. Fewer than five percent of Aussies have been fully vaccinated—12 times fewer than Israel, nine times fewer than the United States and the United Kingdom.

Prosecutors argued that because he plotted the shooting, he was mentally competent and able to conform his actions to meet legal standards.\nOf note: The jury's decision means Ramos will be sentenced to prison, rather than a maximum-security mental health facility.\n\nOur thought bubble, via Axios' Selene San Felice — a survivor of the shooting who testified at the trial last week: The verdict and its swift delivery is a huge relief, but the survivors and family of those who died are all still in so much pain. \n\nTo say this trial reopened a wound is a massive understatement. Don’t just read this news and move on. Do something to prevent the next mass shooting. Show compassion for the people affected by gun violence. Stop letting people like my friends die. And don’t let people like me feel forgotten.\n\nCatch up quick: Ramos shot five people roughly three years ago.\n\nIn July 2011, a Capital Gazette columnist covered a criminal harassment case filed against Ramos.

It has lost more than 90% of its value over the past year.",

Chart: Axios Visuals\nAmericans' trust in all big institutions has cratered, but look at the massive gap in who we do trust.\nBy the numbers: New Gallup polling finds a 45-point split in trust of police — 76% of Republicans vs. 31% of Democrats.  Confidence in the church or organized religion — twice as many Rs as Ds, 51% to 26%. \n\nSo who do Democrats trust instead? \n\nWith President Biden in the White House, 62% of Ds said they trust the presidency vs. 13% of Rs. That's a 49-point delta — the biggest in the survey. \nNo surprise here: Blue America trusts the media by double digits more than red America does. \nBut this is interesting: Twice as many Democrats trust public schools as do Republicans, 43% to 20%. \n\nThe big picture: Overall trust in key U.S. institutions has dropped 10 points in the past decade, according to Gallup, which began tracking the question during the Watergate year of 1973. \n\nThe police (51%) are one of just three institutions in which a majority of Americans express confidence. The others — small business (70%) and the military (69%) — have consistently led the list.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Gallup reports, are Congress, TV news, big business, the criminal justice system and newspapers — each with a confidence rating at or below 21%. Congress (12%) and big business (18%) have ranked at the bottom of the list since 2007.\n\nGallup found a big racial difference in trust of police:\n\n56% of white adults trusted police vs. 27% of Black adults.\nThat's up from 19% of Black adults in 2020, right after the killing of George Floyd. Confidence among whites was unchanged. \n\nThe fine print: The telephone poll of 1,381 U.S. adults was taken June 1 to July 5, with a margin of error of ±3 points for the full sample.\n📊 Go deeper: Read the Gallup report. ...

People are paying down their credit card balances faster, and mom-and-pop shops are holding back on loans. Thank all the stimulus for that.\nWhy it matters: Government aid left consumers and businesses buoyed with cash, so they aren't turning to banks to borrow nearly as much.\n\n\"Consumers have continued to use liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt, driving lower loans,\" Citibank CFO Mark Mason said during the bank's earnings call Wednesday.\n\nWhat's new: Spending is soaring, but loan balances aren't, the big banks said this week.\n\nWells Fargo said Wednesday loan balances are down 10% compared to a year ago — and 6% from the first three months of 2021.\nAt JPMorgan, they're down 3% (but lending is picking up among its wealthiest clients, Bloomberg reports).\n\nThere are some signs of life. Bank of America said consumer banking loans and leases saw the first quarterly uptick in a year — though they're down 12% from 2020.\n\nAnd there's strong demand among consumers that want loans for cars and homes, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday.\n\nBetween the lines: The dynamic is squeezing a profit engine for banks (though they are still making plenty of money).\n\nAn upshot: All the cash sloshing around meant fewer loans going bad — something banks braced for at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nWhat to watch: Executives bet borrowing momentum kicks in when stimulus wears off and the economy revs up.\n\n\"Companies need to build inventory and hire workers to meet the growing customer demand,\" which could spur more borrowing, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Wednesday.",

          "description": "Corporate America is expecting big jumps in profits in the second quarter. That's especially the case in health care, an industry that hasn't really lost a lot of financial momentum throughout the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe bottom line: Health care spending is basically back to pre-COVID levels. Expect big numbers across the board.\n\nWhat to watch: Medical loss ratios, the industry jargon for the percentage of premiums that health insurers pay out in medical claims.\n\nThis statistic is always closely watched because it's the engine of the industry.\nHigher-than-expected ratios mean people are getting more care; which means more money being paid by insurers to hospitals, nursing homes, drug companies, device makers.  etc.. That trickles down in the form of more money to spend on technology, consultants and other vendors.\nIn the same way, lower-than-expected MLRs last year from patients delaying care was a financial boon for insurers.\nUnitedHealth Group, which posted a historically profitable 2020 and is on pace to surpass that total this year, will kick off the industry's earnings season Thursday.\n\nBetween the lines: Wall Street estimates MLRs will be elevated compared with last year, considering COVID cases have decreased and more people are getting procedures and seeing their doctors.\n\nPharmaceutical companies and pharmacies also will benefit from more filled prescriptions and vaccines.\nWall Street expects UnitedHealth's MLR was 83% in the second quarter.\n\nYes, but: Health insurers are still expected to report sizable earnings.\n\nThey aren't paying for as many COVID hospitalizations, which are down significantly from last year and the start of the year, as more people got vaccinated.\nAnd while hospitals and other providers are seeing more patients, the industry isn't assuming a full return to pre-COVID patient volumes until the fourth quarter of this year, according to analysts at Mizuho Securities.\n\nGo deeper: Follow our health care earnings tracker",

The dynamic is playing out on the menu in the form of pricier meals.\n\nOne big factor: Restaurants are paying up to lure employees to staff the comeback. The data is a sign they are passing on the costs.\n\n\"I am a little surprised that food away from home has not accelerated more given the issues around finding staff,\" says ING economist James Knightley.\n\"With reports of rising wages, I suspect that restaurants would be looking to raise their prices more rapidly.\"\n\nIt's not just restaurants.

          "description": "President Biden will nominate former GOP Sen. Jeff Flake as his ambassador to Turkey, bringing in a senior Republican to help emphasize his bipartisan instincts on foreign policy. \nWhy it matters: In picking Flake, Biden is putting his trust in a former politician to handle one of America’s most challenging relationships in NATO.\n\n“Given the strategic importance of the United States’ relationship with our long-time NATO Ally, the Republic of Turkey, I am honored and humbled by the trust President Biden has placed in me with this ambassadorial nomination,” Flake said in a statement.  \n“This is a pivotal post at an important time for both of our countries.\"\nFlake, along with Cindy McCain, had long been considered potential picks to help Biden show his commitment to bipartisanship, Axios reported in February. \n\nThe big picture: Flake, a two-term senator from Arizona, endorsed Biden at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, after deciding he wouldn’t run for re-election in 2018. \n\nHe clashed frequently with then-President Trump and openly questioned his own future in the party. \n\"There may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party,\" he told the Arizona Republic in 2017.",

          "description": "HBO and HBO Max led all Hollywood studios with 130 nominations for the 73rd annual Emmy awards, the Television Academy said Tuesday. If you add up the nominations for networks owned by Disney, including Disney+, Hulu, FX, Nat Geo, and ABC, the company topped HBO and HBO Max with 146 nominations.\nWhy it matters: It's an important milestone for both companies, which are now competing with several tech giants for TV eyeballs, including Netflix, Apple and Amazon. Netflix took home 129 nominations.\n\nThe big picture: With a huge number of Emmy nominations going to streaming shows this year, it's safe to say that streaming television has officially started to edge out traditional TV series when it comes to awards.\nBy the numbers: Several HBO and HBO Max shows took home a number of nominations, including \"Hacks,\" \"Mare of Easttown,\" \"The Flight Attendant,\" \"Lovecraft Country,\" and \"I May Destroy You,\" per Variety. \n\nFollowing HBO and Netflix, Disney+ received 71 nominations, thanks in large part to its hit series \"The Mandalorian,\" which tied with Netflix's \"The Crown\" for the most nominations for a series. Disney's \"WandaVision\" came in a close second with 23 nominations. \nNBCUniversal did well for a broadcast network, pulling in 46 nominations, with about half going to \"Saturday Night Live.\" Its broadcast rival, CBS, received 26 nominations, mostly for its special programming, like the Super Bowl. \nApple TV+ received 34 nominations, with most going to its soccer comedy, \"Ted Lasso.\" Hulu brought in 25, mostly for the \"Handmaid's Tale.\" Amazon Prime Video took home 18 nominations. \n\nBetween the lines: There were also some notable \"firsts\" this year.\n\n\"Pose\" star Mj Rodriguez became the first trans woman nominated in a leading acting category. She was nominated for best actress in a drama series.\nBoth Apple and HBO Max earned their first nominations in the Best Comedy category, per Engadget. \n\nFlashback: HBO's \"Watchmen\" leads 2020 Emmy nominations with 26",

Economists were expecting an increase of 0.4%.\n\nIncluding energy and food prices, the headline CPI figure shows a 0.9% monthly increase, compared to a 0.6% uptick in May. \nOn a yearly basis, June prices shot up 5.4%, compared to the 5% change in May. \n\nThe big picture: The higher-than-expected reading will rekindle debates about whether inflation is truly temporary.\n\nInvestors largely believe elevated levels of inflation will be transitory, as the Fed reiterated in its meeting last month.\nMeanwhile, consumer expectations for inflation over the coming year reached their highest level ever, according to a survey released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nZoom in: Used car prices continued to account for one-third of monthly CPI growth last month, as they did in May.\n\nThe category grew 10.5% in June month over month, compared to 7.3% in May and 10% in April.

What happens in any part of the world affects all other countries.”\nWhy it matters: The spread of the variant has somewhat dampened hopes for a rapid economic rebound. \n\nThe International Monetary Fund has said it still expects the economy to grow at the 6% rate it projected earlier this year, but warned that the variant is threatening growth to developing nations with less access to vaccines.",

The messages varied among Christian churches: \n\n48% of sermons mentioning the election in evangelical Protestant churches discussed specific issues, parties or candidates. Evangelical pastors were more than twice as likely as others to use the phrases \"Satan,\" \"hell\" and \"pray [for our] president.\"\nHistorically Black Protestant pastors were far more likely to encourage voting and turnout, and to reference voter suppression, more than other groups.\n\nWhen discussing racism, evangelical pastors disproportionately leaned on phrases such as \"racial tension.\" Evangelicals also used terms like \"police officer,\" \"crime\" and \"convict\" around three times as often as others. \n\nPastors in mainline and historically Black Protestant congregations used terms like \"anti-racism\" and \"white supremacist\" when talking about racism.\n\nMeanwhile, Catholic priests were least likely to discuss any of these topics during services.\nDetails: The analysis of 12,832 sermons, shared online by 2,143 churches (due to the pandemic), is not necessarily a representative sample of all sermons delivered across the country. \n\nIt provides a glimpse of the messages that churchgoers heard during a pivotal period for the U.S.",

In periods of peace, he writes, a company can focus on expanding and reinforcing its strengths. In times of war, the threats are existential, and the company has to hunker down to fight for survival. \n... \nFrom that day forward, Zuckerberg continued, he was taking on the role of wartime CEO. He would assume more direct control over all aspects of the business. He could no longer sequester himself to focus only on new products. More decisions would fall to him. \nFacebook tells Axios that Zuckerberg instructed leaders they’d have to be more decisive, and would need to move forward even when there wasn't a clear consensus.

Fortunately, unlike 2020, we actually have a tool that stops the Delta variant in its tracks: It's called vaccine,\" he added.\nSlavitt noted the variant presented a \"very little threat\" to fully vaccinated individuals. \n\nZoom out: Virus cases have ticked up around the world. The United Kingdom saw its highest case count since January as the disease spreads among younger age groups.

It asks several agencies to \"update guidelines on banking mergers to provide more robust scrutiny of mergers.\"\nThe bottom line: None of this changes actual antitrust law, to which judges remain beholden. But Biden is staking out a political philosophy that consolidation is antithetical to competition, and likely believes that the threat of regulatory action could scare off some deals from getting signed.",

A trial in New York is also set to begin next year for \"federal charges that he embezzled money from Ms. Daniels,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. \n\nWhat they're saying: \"Michael Avenatti used illegal and extortionate threats and betrayed one of his clients for the purpose of seeking to obtain millions of dollars for himself,\" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a press release.\n\n\"Not only did Avenatti attempt to weaponize his law license and celebrity to seek to extort payments for himself, he also defrauded his own client.

What's notable is that lately, the White House has been getting much more vocal about the CES.\nLast Tuesday top aides Gina McCarthy and Anita Dunn listed it among the priorities, and on Wednesday McCarthy called it one of the \"bottom lines\" for the reconciliation plan.\nBiden's speech on Wednesday may be the first time he's publicly name-checked the policy since it was included in the big infrastructure wish-list the White House released in March.\n\nThe intrigue: How exactly backers will craft a plan to comply with reconciliation, which is designed for spending and revenue measures.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reports that Democrats may set annual clean power targets for utilities to hit.\n\"If utilities hit these targets, they would get financial support from the federal government. If they do not, they would face penalties,\" it reports.\n\nWhat we're watching: Whether the votes are there. Sen. Joe Manchin has been skeptical of a CES, though his office did not respond to an inquiry yesterday about his current thinking.\nAnd a CES would likely need to credit for nuclear power and natural gas with CO2 capture (which is not yet a thing commercially) to win over moderates, but some activists groups oppose those sources.",

No more.\nGoalie Andrei Vasilevskiy, who had a shutout in all four series clinchers and never lost back-to-back games, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs MVP.\n\nState of play: What do you call it when one region dominates in every professional sport? The signs on the edge of town that call Tampa the \"City of Champions\" always felt like a bit of a stretch. Now? Not so much.\n\nThe Lightning join our Super Bowl LV-winning Bucs in the victory circle.\nTwo big, serious questions: Can the Lombardi Trophy fit inside the Stanley Cup? Also, can the Stanley Cup be tossed across the Hillsborough River?\n\nThe big picture: Just 45 years ago, Tampa Bay had no major professional sports franchises. Think about that. \n\nThe difference between this year's win and last year's? The players get to smooch the cup without worrying about COVID. And we'll get to party with them, too.\n\nWhat's next: The pressure is on the Rays to win the World Series.

Lucia Guara, 10, and her 4-year-old sister, Emma, were buried in the same white coffin in a grave alongside their parents, Marcus and Ana Guara, WPLG reports.\n\nGo deeper: Remembering the victims of the Surfside condo collapse\nEditor's note: This is a developing story.

The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince issued a security alert calling on staff to avoid unnecessary travel in the area.\nWhat they're saying: Joseph condemned what he called an \"inhumane and barbaric act,\" adding: \"The country's security situation is under the control of the National Police of Haiti and the Armed Forces of Haiti. Democracy and the republic will win.\"\n\nJoseph said the \"highly coordinated\" attack was carried out by a \"highly trained and heavily armed group\" at around 1am on July 7. He called on the international community to launch an investigation, and for the United Nations Security Council to hold a meeting on Haiti as soon as possible.\n\"We urge Haitians to show restraint and maintain a peaceful environment over the coming days,\" Joseph said.\n\nThe big picture: The violence comes amid increasing political instability in Haiti and calls for Moïse's removal from office before his term ended. Gang violence has spiked significantly in the capital of Port-au-Prince as the country continues to grapple with poverty and a cycle of delayed election.\nGo deeper: Coup claim deepens Haiti's political crisis",

These were the questions behind Frederich Hayek's 1949 essay \"The Intellectuals and Socialism.\" Hayek was a believer in free markets and libertarian politics. When he wrote this essay just  after the Great Depression and World War II, free marketers like Hayek were an extreme minority. Forty years later the situation had flipped: the ideas of Hayek and his fellow free marketers were setting policy across the Western world. \"The Intellectuals and Socialism\" presents the strategy they followed to bring about this terrific change in the climate of ideas.\n\nJoining me (Tanner Greer) to discuss Hayek's seminal essay is Trevor Burrus. Burrus is a research fellow at the Cato Institute whose research focuses on constitutional law. He is the senior editor of the Cato Supreme Court Review and the co-host of the popular libertarian podcast Free Thoughts.\n\nThe full show notes for this episode are available at www.scholars-stage.org.",
